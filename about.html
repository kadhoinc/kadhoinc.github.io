<h1><b>Dhonam Pemba, PhD</b></h1>
<p>Dhonam Pemba, PhD obtained his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from University of California, Irvine and B.S in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins. Dhonam's PhD disseration work was on the development of micro implantable neural interfaces for restoring  and reading neural activity from auditory, motor, visual and central neverous system. Dhonam is a strong believer that proper neural stimulation early in a child's development will help maximize their potential.</p>
